let my_variable = 0;
const MY_CONSTANT: u8 = 0;
static MY_STATIC: u8 = 0;

//You can declare variables using the let, const, or static keywords:
//By default, all variables are immutable. You can make a variable mutable by using the mut keyword:

let mut my_mutable_variable = 0;


//Since Rust is statically typed, you'll need to explicitly type variables – unless the variable is declared with let and the type can be inferred.
